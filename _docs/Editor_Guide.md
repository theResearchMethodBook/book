# Guide for Editors 

This is a guide to the process of editing the book. It is intended for the editors of the book. It documents the workflows that are used to manage the book, onto which the editors agreed. 

## Building the Book

TBD: This section describes the technical process of building and publishing the book.

## Chapter Proposals

TBD

## Accepting Chapters

A chapter is accepted by the editors by labelling the chapter proposal as accepted. This is done by adding the label `accepted` to the chapter proposal issue.

Once accepted the chapter issue remains open. The chapter issue is used to track the progress of the chapter.

The editor who accepted the chapter is responsible for creating the chapter repository. This requires the following steps:

- create a new repository in the `theResearchMethodBook` organization.
- select the `chapter-template` as template for the repository. 
- the name of the repo starts with `chapter-` followed by the shortened chapter title in lower case.
- The description of the repo is the full chapter title.
- The repo is created as public repo.
- After creation, the first to lines in `README.md` file are edited. The heading will be the full title of the chapter, the second line will be removed. 
- In the repo settings only issues are enabled. All other features such as Wikis, Projects or Discussions are disabled.
- The submitting author is added to the repo with the role `Maintain`.

## Rejecting Chapters 

A chapter is rejected by the editors by adding the label `rejected` to the chapter proposal issue. 

The issue will be *closed* afterwards with a rejection comment.

## Reviewing Chapters

TBD: This section describes the process of following up on the progress of a chapter.
